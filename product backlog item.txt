

A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements.
 The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. 
The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development
 team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by 
iteration (scrum)



Product Backlog Item Overview:
Product Backlog Items can range from specifications and requirements, to use cases, epics, User Stories,
 or even bugs and chores. Each PBI must have these qualities:
Description: What the goal of the PBI is.
Value: the Business Value of the PBI as determined by the Product Owner.
Estimate: the Team needs to estimate the relative effort it will take to move the PBI to Done.
Order: The Product Owner needs to prioritize PBIs by their relative value.
Together these qualities make up the Definition of Ready. Having a ready Backlog can double a Team's Velocity. 
Ideally, PBIs reflect the needs of customers or stakeholders. A common way to incorporate the end users' needs is to write the PBI 
in the form of a User Story.
